Please find a simple C-program count_char.c, which counts the
number of occurrences of the letter "a" in an input file.

(a) First compile and run it on your machine to make sure it works.

(b) Then, modify the program to count the number of occurrences of a
given string (instead of a char) in an input file.

This example will be used as a motivator for lexical analyzer generators.
