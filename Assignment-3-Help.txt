Pl see files ic_expr.c as input file sample and ic_expr.i as output file sample for Part-A: Expressions.

Note:
(a) Make the output (intermediate code file) go into argv[2] (similar
to the comment-less output file you have generated in the lex
comments-removal program).
    So, where ever we discussed printf for outputting intermediate
code, make it fprintf...

(b) For post-increment, I am incrementing immediately after storing
original in a temporary variable, and NOT waiting till assignment. You
can do in other ways too (incrementing after the assignment as most
compilers do).

    If anyone finds in C-standard the correct behavior, let me know.

(c) This is a suggestive output; your output need not match this. For instance,
(c.1) the temporary names can be in some another format.
(c.2) for the simple assignment
a = b + c;

it is OK to generate the same single line, and not the 2-lines:
t1 = b + c
a = t1
